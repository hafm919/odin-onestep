# OneStep

This project is **OneStep**, a To-Do App built using **JavaScript**, created as part of **The Odin Project**. It features project-based task organization and special sections for daily tasks and important tasks. The app's **calming and minimalist UI** is designed to provide a stress-free environment for managing your tasks effectively. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of **ES6 modules**, **classes**, **local storage**, **npm**, and **webpack**.

## Features

This project was an opportunity to:

- **Implement ES6 Modules**: Organized the codebase into reusable and maintainable modules.
- **Work with Classes**: Used classes to encapsulate project and task logic.
- **Local Storage**: Learned to store and retrieve user data efficiently.
- **npm**: Managed dependencies and streamlined the development process.
- **Webpack**: Bundled modules and optimized assets for better performance.
- **Event Listeners**: Managed user interactions dynamically with JavaScript.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Updated the user interface in response to changes in the data
